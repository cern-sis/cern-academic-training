    "abstract": "<!--HTML-->b'<p class=\"part\"><span><span>In recent years, a lot has been said about privacy &#8211; the rights to it, related transgressions, reasons to worry. It seems like questions are multiplying at a high rate, but the answers are not. Should we be concerned, and if so, about what? Should I defend myself, can I defend myself? From whom? Are we risking fundamental freedoms when using FAANG products? Is privacy the same as anonymity? Is giving up privacy a necessary cost of technological progress? Do I have a choice? Are governments and corporations fighting each other over us or collaborating against us? Is &#8220;my phone&#8221; truly &#8220;mine&#8221;?</span></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\"part\"><span><span>We propose to examine privacy with a dose of systematization and in three parts. In the first part, we&#8217;ll start weaving a story of how we got here. Starting from the baselines, we&#8217;ll journey through history, philosophy and world changes &#8211; from the concept of walls in a house to identity documents. In the second part, we&#8217;ll discuss our current state, where current worries stem from, current developments and options. We&#8217;ll look at what surveillance capitalism means for society (techies and non-techies alike), how our cloud, Android and i-devices grew, and will look at the fringes. In the third part, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at emerging major trends, future scenarios (dystopian and optimistic alike) and concrete possibilities for reaction or resistance. We&#8217;ll also touch on technical topics such as, for example, the war-like evolution of cryptography.</span></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\"part\">&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\"part\"><span><span>Short bio:</span></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<div class=\"WordSection1\">\\r\\n<div><em>Andrzej Nowak spent the last 15 years at the juncture of technology, business and innovation</em><em><span>.
