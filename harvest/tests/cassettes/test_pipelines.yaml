          class=\"moz-quote-pre\">How trying to solve a straightforward problem - sharing
          computer data at CERN in the 1980\u2019s - involved us unexpectedly with economic,
          political and social issues. A study of disruption at CERN and beyond.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p
          class=\"moz-quote-pre\"><strong>This series:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><span><span>After
          the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) began in 1969, leading
          to the TCP\/IP protocol development in the USA, a period of intense network
          competition began between continents and companies. It lasted for more than
          a decade and affected many protocols and applications. A number of EU-funded
          projects were born and have kept re-incarnating until today. How was email
          done in the early 1990\u2019s? When could we send photos by email for the
          first time? What was the first decade of the World Wide Web like? How did
          HEP move from mainframes to distributed computing? Which manufacturers have
          since dominated the landscape in the process towards today\u2019s computing
          cloud? In this series, we shall try to answer such questions, with contributions
          by some of the makers and leaders of this technology.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p

          earned his BSc at Imperial College and his PhD at Stanford before coming to
          CERN in 1971 to work on computer networking. He coordinated the 1980\u2019s
          introduction of Internet protocols at CERN and taught them internationally
          from 1986. He participated in CERN\u2019s major distributed computing efforts
          from the 1990\u2019s, leading to the replacement of mainframes by clusters,
          and then to the Grid and cloud computing. Ben is an honorary CERN member and
          an active advocate of volunteer computing and citizen science.<\/p>","startDate":{"date":"2022-05-11","time":"16:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"timezone":"Europe\/Zurich","endDate":{"date":"2022-05-11","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"room":"","location":"Zoom","address":"","type":"simple_event","references":[],"_fossil":"conferenceMetadata","categoryId":72,"category":"Academic
