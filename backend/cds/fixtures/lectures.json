Community currencies like the Swiss WIR make use of interpersonal trust relationships to coordinate trade. The EU is investing heavily into the Peppol e-Invoicing network. Invoices that health care providers send to health insurers could benefit from a similar interconnection of bookkeeping systems, with real-time data sharing. In fact, any place where one party sends an invoice to another party, can probably be made more efficient by linking both bookkeeping systems involved. This can be done with anything from simple webhooks to advanced CRDT collaboration protocols. And unlike cryptocurrencies, which are still controlled by rent extractors, Federated Bookkeeping promises to let both trade and credit happen along the same in-network trust lines, and this is a powerful insight. Can Federated Bookkeeping be the real post-capitalist fintech revolution that we initially thought cryptocurrencies would be?</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span>Bio Michiel de Jong:</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Michiel de Jong is an expert in Personal Data Stores and Federated Bookkeeping.

The reasons for gender inequality in the labor market lie both different types of discrimination and motivation which results in self-discrimination.

      "abstract": "<span><span>Robotic Solutions for remote maintenance&nbsp; </span></span>\n\n<p><span><span>Intelligent robotic systems are becoming essential for space applications, industries, nuclear plants and for harsh environments in general, such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) particles accelerator complex and experiments. Robotics technology has huge potential benefits for people and its ultimate scope depends on the way this technology is used. In order to increase safety and machine availability, robots can perform repetitive, unplanned and dangerous tasks, which humans either prefer to avoid or are unable to carry out due to hazards, size constraints, or the extreme environments in which they take place. Nowadays, mechatronic systems use mature technologies that allow their robust and safe use, even in collaboration with human workers. In this presentation, the current status of the robotic activities performed at CERN by the BE-CEM group is presented. Several robotics solutions have been applied in the past years at CERN, as well as custom made robotic devices. New ideas and solution could come in the close future to increase safety of CERN personnel decreasing radiation dose taken. Current and future research and development in robotics done at CERN are described, as well as the results from the commissioning of various novel robotic controls.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span><span>Short bio Mario Di Castro</span></span></strong></p>\n\n<p>Dr. Mario Di Castro received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Naples \"Federico II\", Italy, and the PhD degree from the Polytechnic University of Madrid, Spain. From 2007 until 2011, he works at EMBL c/o DESY in charge of advanced mechatronics solutions for synchrotron beamlines controls. Since 2011, he works at the European Organization for Nuclear Research &nbsp;(CERN) where, since 2018, he leads the Mechatronics, Robotics and Operation section. The section is responsible for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of control systems based on different platforms (PLC,PXI,VME) for movable devices characterized by few um positioning accuracy (e.g. scrapers, collimators, shielding and target) in harsh environment. Important section activities are the design, construction, installation, operation and maintenance of robotic systems used for remote interventions in the whole CERN accelerator complex. His research interests are mainly focused on modular robots, human robot interfaces, machine learning, enhanced reality, automatic controls, mechatronics, motion control in harsh environment and advanced robotics also for search and rescue scenarios.\n&nbsp;</p>\n\nAcademic_Training 0222: https://cern.zoom.us/j/64106986363?pwd=eVozS2RpZ2RtaTVyOVFvOXpEZ1c5dz09",

Haptic feedback can provide better immersion for the operators, allowing them to achieve tasks more intuitively and with finer control, but it can also introduce instabilities and further complexity to the architecture. Different applications of haptic feedback will be presented, showing where it can be useful and where it can be a disadvantage as well.

In this talk, the use of 3D MR HRI environment will be presented and compared with a standard 2D Graphical User Interface (GUI) in order to control a redundant 9 DOF mobile manipulator. The robotic manipulator has been mounted in a robotized train, the CERN Train Inspection Monorail (TIM), used for many inspection tasks and for the Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) robotic measurement in a complex hazardous intervention scenario at CERN. The use case of point cloud real time and reconstruction information for 3D feedback and collision avoidance or detection will be demonstrated. The NASA TLX method of efficiency and workload measurement of an operator, and operator condition monitoring techniques, such as heart rate, Galvanic Skin Response parameters and stress monitoring, will be discussed. An automatic detection and pose estimation with the use of the BLMs and SPS accelerator door tracking and visual servoing will be introduced, as an example of machine learning and AI in robotics at CERN.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Bio&nbsp;Krzysztof Adam Szczurek</strong></p>\n\n<p>Krzysztof Adam Szczurek&nbsp;received the M.Sc.

An emphasis will be put on a very common problem in robotics: finding the necessary configuration of a robot, such that its end-effector reaches the desired position, called inverse kinematics. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated how to use the derived kinematic and dynamic models for design optimization of the mechanical structure, including the optimization of the topology, geometry, torque, error propagation and collision avoidance. The basics of trajectory generation will also be introduced, particularly to generate smooth trajectories that can allow for stable motion of robotic systems.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Short bio Hannes Gamper</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\tBSc in Mechatronics (Specifically Mathematic Modelling &amp; Control Theory) at Johannes Kepler University (Austria)\n\tMSc (~30%) in Computer Science at California State University (USA)\n\tMSc (~70%) in Robotics at Johannes Kepler University (Austria)\n\tFellow at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Systems Engineering for Europa Mission (Lander for Jupiter Moon Europa))\n\tPhD Candidate at CERN since 2019 (Working on a Robotic System for the Future Circular Collider)\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nAcademic_Training 0222: https://cern.zoom.us/j/64106986363?pwd=eVozS2RpZ2RtaTVyOVFvOXpEZ1c5dz09",

      "abstract": "<span><span>Simulation and best practices for remote maintenance </span></span>\n\n<p><span><span>To decrease human exposure to hazards in hostile environments, Remote Handling (RH) tasks \u2015 the action of using a mechatronic device to execute remote-controlled operations \u2015 are needed. At CERN, the BE-CEM group is responsible for planning and safely performing RH operations for remote maintenance. Based on the feedbacks retrieved by the many remote robotic interventions done on the field during the last years, a code of practice framework for remote maintenance has been created to assist design engineers with guidelines to be followed for machine components design to ensure compatibility with remote interventions. Such best practises can be applied also outside CERN, indeed to any environment where robots must dynamically interact with a known and designable environment. This talk will present the status of these best practises and will highlight how they can be applied to new installations at CERN.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Short bio Luca Rosario Buonocore</strong></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Luca Rosario Buonocore received the MD in electronic engineering in 2015, with a master thesis in real-time visual servoing recognition and tracking of aerial robotic platforms.&nbsp;He received a PhD degree in Computer and Automation Engineering at the University of Naples Federico II in 2015.
